## Contributor guidelines

Thanks for improving the World Fermented Foods Database. This project aims to be respectful, evidence-based, and consistent.

## A) How to add a new food entry

1. Copy the template:
   - `_templates/_templates/foods_TEMPLATE.md` (or `_foods/_TEMPLATE.md` if you keep it there)
2. Create a new file in `_foods/`:
   - Example: `_foods/kimchi.md`
3. Fill in **Required fields** (see Metadata Standards).
4. Add at least **one credible reference**.
5. Commit with a clear message:
   - `Add kimchi entry`

---

## B) Naming conventions

- File name: lowercase with underscores, e.g. `beet_kvass.md`
- Title: Title Case, e.g. `Beet Kvass`
- Use consistent continents: `Africa | Asia | Europe | Americas | Oceania`

---

## C) References and claims

- Species-level claims require microbiology sources.
- Cultural/historical claims should cite ethnographic or reputable sources.
- Avoid medical claims unless clearly supported.

---

## D) Respectful documentation

For Indigenous and traditional foods:
- Use respectful language.
- Avoid claiming ownership or “discovery”.
- Prefer sources that credit the originating communities.

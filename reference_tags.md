## Reference tags

Each food entry includes `ref_tags` to indicate what kind of evidence supports the entry. Use one or more of the following tags:

### Core tags
- `microbiology` — culture-based studies, sequencing, microbial ecology, taxonomy
- `food_science` — process parameters, chemistry, sensory, preservation
- `ethnography` — cultural history, traditional methods, anthropology
- `nutrition` — nutrient composition, bioavailability, functional components
- `safety` — pathogens, toxins, detoxification, hygiene, risk
- `technology` — industrial processing, starter development, scale-up
- `review` — review papers or books synthesizing multiple foods

### Rules
- At least **one** tag is required.
- If listing **species**, include `microbiology` or `review`.
- If discussing **health/function**, include `nutrition` (and a credible reference).

**Example:**
`ref_tags: [microbiology, ethnography, food_science]`

## Citation Policy

The **World Fermented Foods Database** is a curated, research-oriented resource documenting traditional fermented foods, their substrates, fermentation processes, and microbial ecology. To maintain scientific integrity, transparency, and reproducibility, the following citation principles apply.

---

## 1. Reference Requirements

Each food entry **should include at least one credible reference**. Acceptable sources include:

- Peer-reviewed journal articles  
- Academic books and book chapters  
- Theses and dissertations  
- Authoritative institutional reports (e.g. FAO, WHO)  

Popular media, blogs, or non-reviewed sources may be used **only for cultural context** and must not be the sole reference.

---

## 2. Reference Scope

References should support one or more of the following aspects of the entry:

- Description of the fermentation process  
- Identification of dominant microorganisms  
- Functional or nutritional characteristics  
- Cultural or historical context  

Where specific microbial species are listed, **microbiological or food science literature is strongly preferred**.

---

## 3. Citation Style

References are currently presented in a **modified Harvard / APA-style format**, including:

- Author(s)  
- Year of publication  
- Title  
- Journal or publisher  
- Volume and page numbers (where applicable)

Consistency across entries is encouraged. Formal DOIs may be added where available.

---

## 4. Traditional Knowledge and Indigenous Foods

Many fermented foods documented in this database originate from **Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems**. Where possible:

- Academic ethnographic or food science sources are cited  
- Cultural significance is described respectfully  
- Claims are framed descriptively, not as ownership or invention  

This database aims to **document and preserve knowledge**, not appropriate it.

---

## 5. Inference and Generalisation

In some cases, microbial ecology or fermentation mechanisms are inferred from closely related foods or well-established fermentation principles. Such cases are:

- Clearly described as generalised or representative  
- Supported by broad fermentation literature (e.g. lactic acid fermentation frameworks)  

As new research becomes available, entries may be updated.

---

## 6. Ongoing Curation and Updates

This database is a **living resource**. Entries may be revised to:

- Incorporate new research  
- Improve microbial specificity  
- Add geographic or process-level detail  

Updates aim to improve accuracy while preserving original context.

## 8. Feedback and Corrections

Scholarly feedback, corrections, and suggested references are welcomed.  
This database values accuracy, transparency, and collaboration.

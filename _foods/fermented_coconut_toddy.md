## Overview
Fermented coconut toddy is a traditional palm sap beverage widely consumed across Pacific Island communities. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of freshly collected coconut palm sap and is consumed as a mildly alcoholic and acidic drink.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh coconut palm sap (*Cocos nucifera*)
- Environmental microorganisms

## Fermentation Process
Sap is collected by tapping the inflorescence of the coconut palm and allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature. Fermentation begins within hours of collection and proceeds for 12–48 hours, during which sugars are converted into ethanol and organic acids. The beverage is typically consumed fresh due to rapid fermentation.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:

- *Saccharomyces* spp.
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

Yeasts are primarily responsible for ethanol production, while lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification and microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Conversion of palm sugars into ethanol and organic acids  
- Mild preservation through acidification  
- Provides calories and micronutrients derived from palm sap  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented coconut toddy plays an important role in social gatherings and daily life in many Pacific Island societies. It reflects traditional knowledge of palm tapping and spontaneous fermentation adapted to tropical island environments.

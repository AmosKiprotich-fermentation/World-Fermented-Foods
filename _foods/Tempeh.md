## Description
Tempeh is a traditional Indonesian fermented soybean product where fungal mycelium binds beans into a firm cake.

## Fermentation process
- Soybeans soaked, dehulled, and cooked
- Inoculated with a starter (commonly *Rhizopus* spp.)
- Incubated ~24–48 h until a compact cake forms

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Starter fungi: *Rhizopus oligosporus* / *Rhizopus* spp.
- Associated bacteria may be present depending on production (variable)

## Functional relevance
- Improved protein digestibility
- Reduced antinutritional factors
- Increased bioavailability of nutrients

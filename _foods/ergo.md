## Overview
Ergo is a traditional Ethiopian fermented milk product produced through spontaneous lactic acid fermentation of fresh milk. It is characterised by a mildly sour taste and thickened consistency and is widely consumed in rural households.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh cow’s milk
- Traditional fermentation container

## Fermentation Process
Fresh milk is placed in a container and allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature for 1–3 days. Indigenous microorganisms present in the milk and container initiate lactic acid fermentation, resulting in acidification and curd formation.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Streptococcus* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria metabolise lactose into lactic acid, lowering pH and improving microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Extended shelf-life of fresh milk  
- Development of sour flavour  
- Improved digestibility of lactose  

## Cultural Significance
Ergo is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an intermediate product in the preparation of traditional Ethiopian dairy foods such as butter and cottage cheese.

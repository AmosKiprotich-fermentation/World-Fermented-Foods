## Overview
Masa is a traditional fermented maize-based food widely consumed in northern Nigeria and parts of Niger. It is prepared from fermented maize batter and cooked as small, soft cakes, often served with soups, sauces, or stews.

## Raw Materials
- Maize grains (*Zea mays*)
- Water
- Optional ingredients (rice, sugar, or potash depending on region)

## Fermentation Process
Maize grains are soaked in water and wet-milled into a slurry. The batter is allowed to ferment naturally for 12–24 hours at ambient temperature. During fermentation, endogenous and environmental microorganisms acidify the batter and contribute to flavour development. The fermented batter is then poured into moulds and cooked.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts

Lactic acid bacteria drive acidification, while yeasts contribute to leavening and flavour complexity.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved digestibility of maize carbohydrates  
- Development of mild sour flavour  
- Soft texture resulting from microbial activity  

## Cultural Significance
Masa is an important street and household food in northern Nigeria and is commonly associated with social gatherings and daily meals. It reflects regional adaptations of cereal fermentation techniques in West Africa.

## Description
Soy sauce is a traditional fermented liquid condiment widely used across East Asia, produced through mixed microbial fermentation of soybeans and wheat.

## Fermentation process
- Soybeans and wheat cooked and inoculated with koji mold
- Solid-state fermentation using *Aspergillus* spp.
- Brine fermentation (moromi stage) lasting months to years
- Liquid extracted, pasteurized, and aged

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Koji mold: *Aspergillus oryzae*, *Aspergillus sojae*
- Brine fermentation: LAB and halotolerant yeasts (e.g., *Zygosaccharomyces* spp.)

## Functional relevance
- Extensive protein and starch hydrolysis
- Development of umami compounds and organic acids
- Natural preservation through salt and acidity

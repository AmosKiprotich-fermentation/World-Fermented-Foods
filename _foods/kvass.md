## Overview
Kvass is a traditional fermented beverage widely consumed in Eastern Europe. It is produced through fermentation of rye bread in water and is characterised by low alcohol content, mild acidity, and a refreshing taste.

## Raw Materials
- Rye bread
- Water
- Sugar (often added)
- Optional flavourings (raisins, herbs)

## Fermentation Process
Rye bread is dried or toasted and soaked in water to extract soluble carbohydrates. Sugar is commonly added, and the liquid is allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days at ambient temperature. After fermentation, the beverage is filtered and consumed fresh.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- Yeasts

Lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification, while yeasts produce small amounts of ethanol and carbon dioxide.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Mild acidification improves sensory properties  
- Low alcohol content allows broad consumption  
- Provides carbohydrates and organic acids  

## Cultural Significance
Kvass is deeply embedded in Eastern European food culture and is commonly prepared at household and artisanal scales. It is traditionally consumed as a refreshing drink and used in cold soups such as okroshka.

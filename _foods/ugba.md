## Overview
Ugba is a traditional fermented food produced from African oil bean seeds and widely consumed in southeastern Nigeria. It is obtained through spontaneous alkaline fermentation and is typically used as a condiment or ingredient in salads and soups.

## Raw Materials
- African oil bean seeds (*Pentaclethra macrophylla*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
African oil bean seeds are boiled to soften the cotyledons, which are then sliced and allowed to ferment naturally for 2–4 days at ambient temperature. During fermentation, microbial activity results in protein degradation and the development of characteristic flavour and aroma.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Bacillus* spp.

These microorganisms produce proteolytic enzymes that break down seed proteins and contribute to the alkaline nature of the product.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Enhanced protein digestibility  
- Development of characteristic flavour  
- Softened texture suitable for consumption  

## Cultural Significance
Ugba is an important component of traditional Igbo cuisine and is commonly incorporated into salads and soups. It represents a typical example of alkaline legume fermentation in West African food systems.

## Overview
**Beet kvass** is a traditional Eastern European fermented beverage produced from raw beetroot. It is lightly acidic, non-alcoholic, and consumed both as a drink and as a culinary ingredient, particularly in soups such as borscht.

## Raw Materials
- Beetroot (*Beta vulgaris*)
- Water
- Salt
- Optional spices (e.g. garlic, bay leaf)

## Fermentation Process
Beetroot is chopped and submerged in salted water. The mixture is fermented spontaneously at ambient temperature for **2–7 days**. Lactic acid fermentation rapidly lowers pH, producing a mildly sour beverage that can be consumed fresh or refrigerated.

## Microbial Ecology
The fermentation is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, primarily:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These organisms drive acidification and contribute to flavour and microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Rich in organic acids and beet-derived phytochemicals  
- Acidification improves shelf-life and safety  
- Traditionally associated with digestive health  

## Cultural Significance
Beet kvass has long been prepared in Eastern European households as a winter beverage and food preservative. It reflects traditional vegetable fermentation practices in temperate climates.

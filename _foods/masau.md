## Overview
**Masau** is a traditional fermented breadfruit product consumed in parts of Melanesia, particularly Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation and serves as a preserved staple food during periods of breadfruit abundance.

## Raw Materials
- Breadfruit (*Artocarpus altilis*)
- Water (optional, depending on method)

## Fermentation Process
Ripe breadfruit is peeled, mashed, and packed into pits or containers lined with leaves. The mash is allowed to ferment naturally under anaerobic conditions for **several days to weeks**. The fermented paste may be cooked before consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, primarily:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

These microorganisms acidify the substrate, inhibit spoilage organisms, and stabilize the product for extended storage.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Long-term preservation of a seasonal crop  
- Improved digestibility of carbohydrates  
- Acidic flavour and soft texture suitable for cooking  

## Cultural Significance
Masau plays an important role in food security in Melanesian communities and reflects Indigenous knowledge of plant-based fermentation and storage in tropical island environments.

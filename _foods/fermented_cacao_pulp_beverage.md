## Overview
Fermented cacao pulp beverage is a traditional drink produced from the sweet pulp surrounding cacao beans. It undergoes spontaneous fermentation and is consumed fresh in cacao-growing regions of Mesoamerica.

## Raw Materials
- Cacao pulp (*Theobroma cacao*)
- Water
- Environmental microorganisms

## Fermentation Process
Fresh cacao pulp is separated from beans and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days at ambient temperature. Fermentation proceeds rapidly due to high sugar content and native microbial populations.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- Yeasts
- Lactic acid bacteria

Yeasts convert sugars into ethanol, while lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification and flavour development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Utilisation of cacao by-products  
- Production of organic acids and ethanol  
- Refreshing, mildly alcoholic beverage  

## Cultural Significance
The beverage reflects traditional cacao utilisation beyond chocolate production and represents Indigenous knowledge of whole-fruit fermentation.

## Overview
**Sauermilch** refers to traditionally fermented milk products produced in Central Europe through lactic acid fermentation. These products represent early dairy fermentations used to preserve milk before refrigeration.

## Raw Materials
- Raw or pasteurised cow’s milk
- Lactic acid bacteria (natural or back-slopped cultures)

## Fermentation Process
Milk is inoculated naturally or by back-slopping and incubated at ambient or mildly warm temperatures for **12–24 hours**. Lactic acid bacteria ferment lactose into lactic acid, causing milk coagulation and acidification.

## Microbial Ecology
The dominant microorganisms include:
- *Lactococcus lactis*
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

These organisms rapidly lower pH, improving safety and shelf-life.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved lactose digestibility  
- Extended shelf-life compared to fresh milk  
- Mild acidic flavour and soft texture  

## Cultural Significance
Sauermilch products laid the foundation for modern European cultured dairy foods such as yogurt, quark, and sour cream, and reflect traditional household fermentation practices.

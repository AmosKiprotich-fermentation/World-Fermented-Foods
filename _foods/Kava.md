- Mixed with water and kneaded or strained
- Short spontaneous fermentation may occur during preparation and holding

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Mixed bacterial and yeast communities have been reported
- Microbiota remain poorly characterised compared to food fermentations

## Functional relevance
- Production of psychoactive kavalactones
- Cultural and ceremonial significance
- Mild acidification and microbial activity during preparation

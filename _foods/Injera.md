## Description
Injera is a soft, sour fermented flatbread central to Ethiopian and Eritrean cuisine, typically used as both food and utensil.

## Fermentation process
- Teff flour mixed with water to form a batter
- Spontaneous fermentation for ~2–3 days
- Partial cooking step (“absit”) may be added to promote leavening
- Batter baked on a hot griddle into a porous flatbread

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- LAB: *Lactobacillus* spp., *Pediococcus* spp., *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts: *Saccharomyces* spp., *Candida* spp. (varies by region/process)

## Functional relevance
- Improved mineral bioavailability and digestibility
- Organic acid production contributing to flavor and preservation

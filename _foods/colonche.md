## Overview
Colonche is a traditional fermented beverage produced in central and northern Mexico from the fruit of prickly pear cactus (*Opuntia* spp.). It is characterised by a reddish colour and mild alcohol content resulting from spontaneous fermentation.

## Raw Materials
- Prickly pear cactus fruit (*Opuntia* spp.)
- Water (minimal or none)
- Indigenous microorganisms

## Fermentation Process
Ripe cactus fruits are peeled and crushed to extract juice. The juice is placed in containers and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days at ambient temperature. Fermentation converts fruit sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The beverage is consumed fresh, as it has limited storage stability.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Saccharomyces* spp.
- Non-*Saccharomyces* yeasts

Yeasts drive alcoholic fermentation, while minor bacterial populations may contribute to acidity and flavour variation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Conversion of fruit sugars into ethanol  
- Retention of cactus-derived pigments and bioactive compounds  
- Mild preservation through fermentation  

## Cultural Significance
Colonche is associated with seasonal harvests of prickly pear fruit and reflects Indigenous and rural Mexican fermentation traditions. It remains an example of fruit-based spontaneous fermentation adapted to arid environments.

## Overview
Mead is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage produced from honey and water and is considered one of the oldest known fermented drinks in Europe. It is obtained through yeast-driven fermentation of honey sugars and varies widely in alcohol content and flavour depending on production practices.

## Raw Materials
- Honey
- Water
- Indigenous or selected yeast cultures

## Fermentation Process
Honey is diluted with water to form a fermentable must, which is then allowed to ferment spontaneously or following inoculation with yeast. Fermentation typically proceeds over several weeks to months, during which sugars are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The beverage may be aged to develop flavour complexity before consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Saccharomyces* spp.

Yeasts are responsible for alcoholic fermentation, while limited bacterial activity may occur depending on hygiene and fermentation conditions.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Conversion of honey sugars into ethanol  
- Retention of honey-derived aromatic compounds  
- Fermentation enhances flavour complexity  

## Cultural Significance
Mead has deep historical and cultural roots in Europe, particularly in Northern and Central regions, where it is associated with ceremonial use, folklore, and early agricultural societies prior to widespread cereal cultivation.

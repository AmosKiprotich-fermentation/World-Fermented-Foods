## Description
Yogurt is a fermented milk product widely consumed in Europe and beyond, produced using defined lactic acid bacteria starter cultures.

## Fermentation process
- Milk heated to denature whey proteins
- Cooled and inoculated with starter cultures
- Incubated at elevated temperature (~42–45 °C) until coagulation

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* subsp. *bulgaricus*
- *Streptococcus thermophilus*

## Functional relevance
- Rapid acidification improves safety and texture
- Enhanced lactose digestibility
- Widely used as a probiotic delivery matrix (strain-dependent)

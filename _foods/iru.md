## Overview
Iru is a traditional fermented condiment produced from African locust bean seeds and widely consumed in southwestern Nigeria. It is obtained through spontaneous alkaline fermentation and is commonly used as a seasoning in soups and stews.

## Raw Materials
- African locust bean seeds (*Parkia biglobosa*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Locust bean seeds are boiled to soften the cotyledons and then allowed to ferment naturally for 2–3 days at ambient temperature. During fermentation, microbial activity leads to extensive protein breakdown and the development of characteristic aroma and flavour.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Bacillus* spp.

These microorganisms produce proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyse seed proteins and contribute to the alkaline nature of the product.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Enhanced protein digestibility  
- Development of strong characteristic flavour  
- Used in small quantities as seasoning  

## Cultural Significance
Iru is an essential component of traditional Yoruba cuisine and plays an important role in enhancing the flavour of vegetable and meat-based soups.

## Overview
**Kaanga pirau** is a traditional Māori fermented maize product from Aotearoa (New Zealand). It is produced through prolonged anaerobic fermentation and is characterised by a strong aroma and acidic flavour.

## Raw Materials
- Maize kernels (*Zea mays*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Whole maize cobs or kernels are submerged in water and fermented anaerobically, traditionally in pits or containers, for **weeks to several months**. The extended fermentation results in extensive acidification and softening of the maize, after which the product is cooked before consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
The fermentation is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, particularly:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

These microorganisms drive acid production and preservation during long-term fermentation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Long-term preservation of maize  
- Improved starch digestibility after cooking  
- High organic acid content contributing to stability  

## Cultural Significance
Kaanga pirau is an important traditional food among Māori communities and reflects Indigenous fermentation practices adapted to temperate island environments. Its preparation and consumption are closely tied to cultural identity and communal knowledge.

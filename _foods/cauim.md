## Overview
**Cauim** is a traditional Indigenous fermented beverage from Brazil, produced primarily from cassava. It is mildly alcoholic and acidic, and historically formed an important part of social and ceremonial life among several Amazonian communities.

## Raw Materials
- Cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water  
- Saliva (traditional preparation; provides amylolytic enzymes)

## Fermentation Process
Cassava roots are peeled, cooked, and mashed. In traditional practice, portions of the mash are chewed and returned to the mixture to introduce salivary amylases, which hydrolyse starch into fermentable sugars. The mash is then diluted with water and fermented spontaneously for **1–3 days**, producing a lightly alcoholic beverage.

## Microbial Ecology
Cauim fermentation involves a mixed microbial community including:
- Lactic acid bacteria (*Lactobacillus* spp.)
- Yeasts (various fermentative species)

This mixed ecology results in ethanol production, acidification, and flavour development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Conversion of starch into fermentable sugars  
- Reduction of cyanogenic compounds through processing  
- Provides energy and hydration  

## Cultural Significance
Cauim holds strong cultural importance among Indigenous Amazonian peoples and reflects traditional biochemical knowledge of starch conversion and fermentation long before the introduction of industrial starters.

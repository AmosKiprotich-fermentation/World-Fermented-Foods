## Overview
Cauim is a traditional fermented beverage produced by Indigenous communities in Brazil. It is commonly made from cassava and undergoes spontaneous fermentation, resulting in a mildly alcoholic drink.

## Raw Materials
- Cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water
- Saliva or environmental inoculum (traditional practice)

## Fermentation Process
Cassava is cooked, mashed, and mixed with water. In some traditional practices, mastication introduces fermentative microorganisms. The mixture is allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days before consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- Yeasts
- Lactic acid bacteria

These microorganisms convert carbohydrates into ethanol and organic acids.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Partial detoxification of cassava  
- Production of organic acids and ethanol  
- Enhanced palatability  

## Cultural Significance
Cauim holds ceremonial and social importance among Indigenous groups and represents one of the oldest documented fermentation practices in South America.

## Overview
**Atole agrio** is a traditional fermented maize beverage consumed in parts of southern Mexico, particularly in Oaxaca. Unlike sweet atole preparations, atole agrio is acidic and results from spontaneous lactic acid fermentation of maize dough or slurry.

## Raw Materials
- Maize kernels (*Zea mays*)
- Water
- Lime (calcium hydroxide; for nixtamalization)

## Fermentation Process
Maize kernels are nixtamalized with lime, ground into dough, and mixed with water. The slurry is allowed to ferment spontaneously for **1–3 days**, during which lactic acid bacteria acidify the mixture. The fermented slurry is then cooked to produce a thick, sour beverage.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, primarily:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These organisms drive rapid acidification and inhibit spoilage microorganisms.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved mineral bioavailability following nixtamalization and fermentation  
- Acidification enhances microbial safety  
- Provides sustained energy from fermented starch  

## Cultural Significance
Atole agrio is part of Indigenous Zapotec and Mixtec food traditions and reflects long-standing knowledge of maize processing, fermentation, and culinary adaptation to local environments.

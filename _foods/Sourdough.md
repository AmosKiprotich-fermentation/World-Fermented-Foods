## Description
Sourdough is a traditional fermented bread produced through a stable symbiosis of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts maintained by back-slopping.

## Fermentation process
- Flour and water mixed to form a starter
- Starter refreshed regularly (back-slopping)
- Dough fermented prior to baking for several hours

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- LAB: *Lactobacillus* (now *Lactiplantibacillus*/*Fructilactobacillus*) spp.
- Yeasts: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, *Kazachstania* spp.

## Functional relevance
- Acidification improves mineral bioavailability
- Reduced glycaemic response compared to baker’s yeast breads
- Development of flavor and texture through mixed fermentation

## Description
Dosa is a traditional South Indian fermented batter pancake prepared from rice and black gram, valued for its sour flavor, crisp texture, and digestibility.

## Fermentation process
- Rice and black gram soaked separately and wet-milled
- Batters mixed with salt and left to ferment overnight (8–16 h)
- Fermented batter cooked on a hot griddle into thin pancakes

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- LAB: *Lactobacillus* spp., *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts: *Saccharomyces* spp. (variable by household process)

## Functional relevance
- Acidification improves safety and sensory quality
- Enhanced digestibility and nutrient bioavailability

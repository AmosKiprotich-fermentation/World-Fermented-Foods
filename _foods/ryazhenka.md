## Overview
**Ryazhenka** is a traditional fermented milk product from Eastern Europe, produced from baked milk followed by lactic acid fermentation. It is characterised by a caramelised flavour, creamy texture, and mild acidity.

## Raw Materials
- Cow’s milk
- Thermophilic lactic acid starter cultures

## Fermentation Process
Milk is slowly heated and baked for several hours, causing Maillard reactions that give the milk a light brown colour and caramel flavour. After cooling, the milk is inoculated with starter cultures and fermented at **warm temperatures (35–40 °C)** for **4–8 hours** until thickened.

## Microbial Ecology
The fermentation is dominated by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria, primarily:
- *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* subsp. *bulgaricus*
- *Streptococcus thermophilus*

These organisms drive acidification and texture development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved lactose digestibility  
- Rich flavour due to heat-induced milk protein modification  
- Extended shelf-life compared to fresh milk  

## Cultural Significance
Ryazhenka has been consumed in Slavic regions for centuries and represents a distinctive combination of **thermal processing and fermentation**, reflecting traditional household dairy preservation practices.

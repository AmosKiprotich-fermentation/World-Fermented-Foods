## Overview
**Skyr** is a traditional Icelandic cultured dairy product with characteristics of both yogurt and fresh cheese. It has been produced in Iceland for over a millennium and is notable for its high protein content and low fat levels.

## Raw Materials
- Skimmed cow’s milk
- Starter cultures
- Rennet (traditional preparation)

## Fermentation Process
Milk is heated, cooled, and inoculated with defined lactic acid bacterial cultures. Fermentation occurs at controlled temperatures, followed by straining to remove whey, resulting in a thick, protein-rich product.

## Microbial Ecology
The fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactococcus lactis*
- *Streptococcus thermophilus*

These bacteria drive acidification and texture development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- High protein concentration  
- Improved lactose digestibility  
- Long refrigerated shelf-life compared to fresh milk  

## Cultural Significance
Skyr is a cornerstone of Icelandic food culture and exemplifies the adaptation of dairy fermentation to cold-climate environments.

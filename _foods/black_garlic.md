## Description
Black garlic is produced by controlled aging of garlic bulbs under warm, humid conditions, resulting in darkened cloves with sweet, umami-rich flavor.

## Fermentation process
- Whole garlic bulbs held at elevated temperature and humidity
- Process lasts several weeks
- Non-enzymatic browning and limited microbial activity occur

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Microbial contribution is limited; chemical transformations dominate

## Functional relevance
- Increased antioxidant activity
- Enhanced flavor and reduced pungency

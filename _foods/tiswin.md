## Overview
**Tiswin**, also known as **Tesgüino**, is a traditional fermented maize beer prepared by Indigenous peoples of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, particularly among the Rarámuri (Tarahumara). It is mildly alcoholic and consumed in social, ritual, and ceremonial contexts.

## Raw Materials
- Maize kernels (*Zea mays*)
- Water
- Germinated maize (as a source of enzymes)

## Fermentation Process
Maize kernels are soaked and germinated to activate endogenous amylases, then cooked and mashed. The mash is diluted with water and allowed to ferment spontaneously for **1–3 days**. The beverage is consumed fresh and unfiltered.

## Microbial Ecology
Tiswin fermentation is driven by a mixed microbial consortium including:
- Yeasts (*Saccharomyces* spp.) responsible for ethanol production  
- Lactic acid bacteria (*Lactobacillus* spp.) contributing to acidification  

This mixed fermentation produces a lightly alcoholic, mildly sour beverage.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Enzymatic conversion of starch into fermentable sugars  
- Provides readily available calories and hydration  
- Mild acidity contributes to short-term preservation  

## Cultural Significance
Tiswin plays a central role in Rarámuri cultural life, used in communal labour, festivals, and religious ceremonies. Its preparation reflects sophisticated Indigenous knowledge of malting and fermentation.

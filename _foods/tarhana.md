## Overview
Tarhana is a traditional fermented cereal–dairy product used as a soup base in Turkey and surrounding regions. It is produced through fermentation of a mixture of wheat flour, yogurt, and vegetables.

## Raw Materials
- Wheat flour
- Yogurt
- Vegetables (tomato, pepper, onion)
- Salt

## Fermentation Process
Ingredients are mixed into a dough and allowed to ferment naturally for several days. The fermented mixture is then dried and stored, later reconstituted with water to prepare soup.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- Yeasts

These microorganisms acidify the mixture and contribute to flavour and preservation prior to drying.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Combined benefits of cereal and dairy fermentation  
- Acidification improves shelf-life  
- Drying enables long-term storage  

## Cultural Significance
Tarhana is a widely consumed traditional food in Turkey and reflects household-scale fermentation adapted for seasonal preservation.

## Description
Gochujang is a traditional Korean fermented chili paste used as a seasoning and cooking base, produced through long fermentation of grains and soy with chili.

- Chili and salt added
- Fermented for months in earthenware jars with seasonal temperature cycling

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Molds: *Aspergillus* spp. (starter-dependent)

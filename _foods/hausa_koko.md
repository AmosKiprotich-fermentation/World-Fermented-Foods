## Overview
Hausa Koko is a traditional fermented millet porridge widely consumed in Ghana, particularly in the southern regions where it is associated with Hausa culinary traditions. It is characterised by a mildly sour taste and is typically consumed as a breakfast beverage.

## Raw Materials
- Millet grains (*Pennisetum glaucum*)
- Water
- Spices (ginger, cloves, pepper; regionally variable)

## Fermentation Process
Millet grains are soaked, wet-milled, and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days at ambient temperature. The fermented slurry is then diluted with water and cooked into a thin porridge. Spices are often added during milling or cooking to enhance flavour.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts

Lactic acid bacteria drive acidification, while yeasts may contribute to flavour development during fermentation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved digestibility of millet carbohydrates  
- Development of mild acidity and enhanced flavour  
- Short fermentation improves microbial safety  

## Cultural Significance
Hausa Koko is widely sold as a street food and breakfast beverage in Ghana. It represents the adaptation of millet fermentation techniques within West African urban food systems and reflects intercultural culinary exchange.

## Overview
Fermented pickles are traditional preserved vegetables produced through lactic acid fermentation of cucumbers in brine. This process has been widely practiced across Europe as a method of vegetable preservation and flavour development.

## Raw Materials
- Cucumbers (*Cucumis sativus*)
- Salt
- Water
- Optional spices (garlic, dill, mustard seeds)

## Fermentation Process
Fresh cucumbers are submerged in a salt brine and allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature. Fermentation typically proceeds for 5–14 days, during which lactic acid bacteria convert sugars into organic acids, lowering the pH and stabilising the product.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These microorganisms drive acidification, inhibit spoilage organisms, and contribute to flavour and texture changes.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Preservation through acidification  
- Development of sour flavour and crisp texture  
- Retention of vegetable-derived micronutrients  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented pickles are integral to traditional European diets and are commonly served as accompaniments to meals. They represent a foundational example of household-scale lactic acid fermentation.

## Overview
Kule naoto is a traditional fermented milk product consumed by pastoral communities in northern Kenya. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of fresh milk and is characterised by a mildly sour taste and thickened consistency.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh milk (commonly from cattle or goats)
- Traditional fermentation container (gourd or calabash)

## Fermentation Process
Fresh milk is placed in a container and allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature for 1–3 days. Indigenous microorganisms present in the milk and container drive lactic acid fermentation, resulting in acidification and coagulation.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Streptococcus* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria convert lactose into lactic acid, lowering pH and enhancing microbial safety.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved shelf-life of fresh milk  
- Development of sour flavour  
- Increased digestibility of lactose  

## Cultural Significance
Kule naoto is an important dietary component among pastoralist groups in northern Kenya and reflects traditional milk preservation practices adapted to arid environments.

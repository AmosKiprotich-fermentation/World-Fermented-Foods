## Overview
Fermented coconut cream, locally referred to in some Pacific Island communities as *miti hue*, is a traditional fermented coconut product produced through spontaneous fermentation of freshly extracted coconut cream. It is used as a flavouring agent or accompaniment in cooked dishes.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh coconut cream (*Cocos nucifera*)
- Environmental microorganisms

## Fermentation Process
Fresh coconut cream is extracted from grated coconut flesh and left to ferment naturally at ambient temperature. Fermentation typically proceeds for 24–72 hours, during which microbial activity leads to acidification and flavour development. The fermented cream is commonly heated before consumption or incorporation into dishes.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:

- Lactic acid bacteria

These microorganisms lower the pH of the coconut cream, contributing to flavour development and suppression of spoilage organisms during short-term storage.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Acidification enhances flavour complexity  
- Short-term preservation of coconut cream  
- Provides dietary fats and energy  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented coconut cream is part of traditional Pacific Island food practices, particularly in coastal and island environments where coconut is a central dietary resource. Its use reflects Indigenous knowledge of coconut processing and fermentation to enhance flavour and usability.

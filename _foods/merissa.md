## Overview
Merissa is a traditional fermented sorghum-based beverage widely consumed in Sudan. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation and is characterised by mild acidity and low alcohol content.

## Raw Materials
- Sorghum grains (*Sorghum bicolor*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Sorghum grains are soaked, malted, and milled into flour. The flour is mixed with water and allowed to ferment naturally for 2–4 days at ambient temperature. During fermentation, indigenous microorganisms convert sugars into organic acids and ethanol.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Saccharomyces* spp.

Lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification, while yeasts are responsible for alcoholic fermentation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved digestibility of sorghum carbohydrates  
- Development of mild acidity  
- Production of low levels of ethanol  

## Cultural Significance
Merissa is traditionally consumed as a beverage in Sudanese communities and plays an important role in social and cultural practices.

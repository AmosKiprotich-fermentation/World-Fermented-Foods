## Overview
**Tucupi** is a traditional fermented cassava juice from the Amazon region of Brazil. It is produced from the liquid extracted during cassava processing and is used as a base for soups and sauces.

## Raw Materials
- Bitter cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Cassava roots are grated and pressed to extract juice. The liquid is allowed to ferment spontaneously for **1–3 days**, followed by boiling to inactivate residual cyanogenic compounds and stabilize the product.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by lactic acid bacteria, which:
- Lower pH
- Contribute to flavour development
- Improve microbiological safety

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Detoxification through fermentation and heat treatment  
- Acidic flavour profile used in culinary applications  
- Preservation of cassava-derived nutrients  

## Cultural Significance
Tucupi is central to Amazonian cuisine and is traditionally used in dishes such as *pato no tucupi*, reflecting Indigenous cassava-processing knowledge.

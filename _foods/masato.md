## Overview
Masato is a traditional fermented cassava beverage widely consumed by Indigenous communities in the Amazon basin. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of cooked cassava mash and consumed as a mildly alcoholic drink.

## Raw Materials
- Cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water
- Environmental microorganisms

## Fermentation Process
Cassava roots are peeled, cooked, and mashed into a paste. The mash is mixed with water and allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature for 1–3 days. Traditional preparation may involve mastication to introduce fermentative microorganisms.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- Yeasts
- Lactic acid bacteria

These microorganisms convert carbohydrates into ethanol and organic acids, contributing to flavour and preservation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Partial detoxification of cassava  
- Production of ethanol and organic acids  
- Provides energy and hydration  

## Cultural Significance
Masato is central to social interaction and daily life in Amazonian Indigenous cultures and is often shared during communal gatherings.

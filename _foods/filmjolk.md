## Overview
**Filmjölk** is a traditional Swedish fermented milk product with a mild acidity and pourable consistency. It is commonly consumed as a breakfast food and represents a mesophilic dairy fermentation.

## Raw Materials
- Cow’s milk
- Mesophilic starter cultures

## Fermentation Process
Milk is inoculated with starter cultures and incubated at **ambient temperatures (20–25 °C)** for **12–24 hours**. Mesophilic lactic acid bacteria drive fermentation, producing lactic acid and aroma compounds.

## Microbial Ecology
Key microorganisms include:
- *Lactococcus lactis*
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These species contribute to acidification and subtle buttery flavours.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved lactose digestibility  
- Mild flavour suitable for daily consumption  
- Source of live lactic acid bacteria  

## Cultural Significance
Filmjölk has a long history in Scandinavian food culture and exemplifies traditional low-temperature dairy fermentation adapted to northern climates.

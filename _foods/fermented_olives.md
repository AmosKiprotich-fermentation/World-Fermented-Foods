## Overview
Fermented olives are a traditional Mediterranean food produced by brine fermentation of olive fruits. Fermentation reduces bitterness and enhances flavour, making olives suitable for consumption.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh olives (*Olea europaea*)
- Salt
- Water (brine)

## Fermentation Process
Olives are submerged in brine and allowed to ferment spontaneously over weeks to months. Lactic acid fermentation reduces phenolic bitterness and stabilises the product.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These microorganisms drive acidification and contribute to flavour development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Reduction of bitter phenolic compounds  
- Improved shelf-life through acidification  
- Retains lipids and antioxidant compounds  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented olives are central to Mediterranean diets and represent one of the oldest documented vegetable fermentations in Europe.

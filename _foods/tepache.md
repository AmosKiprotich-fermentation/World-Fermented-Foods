## Overview
**Tepache** is a traditional Mexican fermented beverage made primarily from pineapple peels. It is lightly alcoholic, mildly acidic, and commonly consumed as a refreshing drink, particularly in central and southern Mexico.

## Raw Materials
- Pineapple peels and pulp (*Ananas comosus*)
- Water
- Unrefined sugar (e.g. piloncillo or brown sugar)
- Spices (often cinnamon; optional)

## Fermentation Process
Pineapple peels are submerged in water with added sugar and spices. The mixture is allowed to ferment spontaneously at ambient temperature for **1–3 days**. Yeasts initiate alcoholic fermentation, while lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification. The beverage is typically consumed fresh after brief fermentation.

## Microbial Ecology
Tepache fermentation involves a mixed microbial consortium, including:
- Yeasts (*Saccharomyces* spp. and non-*Saccharomyces* yeasts)
- Lactic acid bacteria (*Lactobacillus* spp.)

This mixed ecology produces ethanol, organic acids, and aromatic compounds.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Low alcohol content (typically <3%)  
- Utilisation of fruit by-products (pineapple peels)  
- Organic acids contribute to flavour and short-term preservation  

## Cultural Significance
Tepache has pre-Hispanic origins and remains widely produced at household and street-vendor levels. It represents an accessible, low-technology fermentation embedded in everyday Mexican food culture.

## Overview
Eko, also known as Agidi, is a traditional fermented maize-based food widely consumed in Nigeria. It is prepared from fermented maize slurry that is cooked into a semi-solid gel and commonly served as a staple accompaniment.

## Raw Materials
- Maize grains (*Zea mays*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Maize grains are soaked, wet-milled, and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days to produce a sour slurry. The fermented slurry is then cooked in boiling water with continuous stirring until it forms a firm gel, which is moulded and cooled prior to consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria acidify the slurry prior to cooking, contributing to flavour and microbial safety.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved digestibility of maize carbohydrates  
- Development of mild sour flavour  
- Cooking enhances texture and stability  

## Cultural Significance
Eko is widely consumed as a breakfast or staple food in southwestern Nigeria and is commonly paired with soups, stews, or bean-based dishes.

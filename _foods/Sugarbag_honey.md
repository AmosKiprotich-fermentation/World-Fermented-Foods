## Description
Sugarbag honey is a traditional Indigenous Australian food produced by stingless bees (*Tetragonula* spp.), characterized by natural fermentation and high moisture content.

## Fermentation process
- Honey is stored by stingless bees in resin pots
- High moisture content enables natural fermentation
- Fermentation occurs in-hive under ambient tropical conditions

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Yeasts associated with osmophilic environments
- Lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria have been reported
- Microbial composition varies by region and hive conditions

## Functional relevance
- Distinct acidic and complex flavor profile
- Naturally fermented and microbiologically active
- Cultural significance in Indigenous Australian food systems

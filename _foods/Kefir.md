## Description
Kefir is a traditional fermented milk beverage originating from the Caucasus region, produced using kefir grains containing a complex symbiotic community of microorganisms.

## Fermentation process
- Milk inoculated with kefir grains
- Fermented at ambient temperature for ~18–24 h
- Grains removed and reused for subsequent fermentations

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- LAB: *Lactobacillus kefiri*, *Lactococcus lactis*, *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts: *Saccharomyces*, *Kluyveromyces*, *Candida* spp.
- Acetic acid bacteria may be present at low abundance

## Functional relevance
- Production of organic acids, ethanol, and CO₂
- Reported probiotic-associated properties (strain-dependent)
- Enhanced digestibility of lactose

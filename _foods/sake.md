## Overview
Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage produced from polished rice through a unique fermentation system involving simultaneous saccharification and alcoholic fermentation. It is characterised by a clean flavour profile and moderate alcohol content.

## Raw Materials
- Polished rice (*Oryza sativa*)
- Water
- Koji mold (*Aspergillus oryzae*)
- Sake yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)

## Fermentation Process
Rice is washed, steamed, and inoculated with *Aspergillus oryzae* to produce koji, which enzymatically converts rice starch into fermentable sugars. The koji is mixed with steamed rice, water, and yeast in a controlled multi-stage fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation proceeds over several weeks at low temperatures, producing sake.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Aspergillus oryzae*
- *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

The mold provides amylolytic enzymes for starch breakdown, while yeast converts sugars into ethanol in a parallel fermentation process.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Efficient conversion of rice starch into ethanol  
- Development of complex flavour and aroma compounds  
- Fermentation enhances digestibility of rice components  

## Cultural Significance
Sake holds significant cultural importance in Japan and is closely associated with religious ceremonies, seasonal festivals, and social traditions. It represents a highly refined form of cereal fermentation unique to East Asian food systems.

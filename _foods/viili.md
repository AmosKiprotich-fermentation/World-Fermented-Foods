## Overview
Viili is a traditional Finnish fermented milk product characterised by a thick, ropy texture and mild sour flavour. It is produced through controlled lactic acid fermentation using a defined starter culture.

## Raw Materials
- Cow’s milk
- Starter culture

## Fermentation Process
Milk is inoculated with a starter culture and fermented at low ambient temperatures for 12–24 hours. The product is not heated after fermentation, allowing live lactic acid bacteria to remain active.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactococcus lactis*
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These microorganisms produce lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharides that contribute to viili’s distinctive texture.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Mild acidification enhances digestibility  
- Production of exopolysaccharides improves texture  
- Consumed without heat treatment  

## Cultural Significance
Viili is a traditional household fermented milk in Finland and reflects Northern European low-temperature dairy fermentation practices.

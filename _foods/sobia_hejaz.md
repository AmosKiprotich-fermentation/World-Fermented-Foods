## Overview
Sobia is a traditional fermented beverage widely consumed in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia. It is characterised by a mildly sour taste and low alcohol content resulting from spontaneous fermentation of cereal-based substrates.

## Raw Materials
- Barley or dried bread
- Sugar
- Water
- Optional flavourings (cardamom, cinnamon)

## Fermentation Process
Barley grains or dried bread are soaked and mixed with water and sugar to produce a fermentable slurry. The mixture is allowed to ferment naturally for 1–2 days at ambient temperature. Indigenous microorganisms drive lactic acid fermentation with minor alcoholic activity.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- Yeasts

Lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification, while yeasts may produce small amounts of ethanol and flavour compounds.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Development of mild acidity  
- Short-term preservation  
- Improved sensory properties  

## Cultural Significance
Sobia is widely consumed as a refreshing beverage in the Hejaz region, particularly during the month of Ramadan. It represents a traditional cereal-based fermentation adapted to arid climatic conditions.

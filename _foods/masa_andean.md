## Overview
Masa is a traditional fermented maize dough used in parts of the Andean region of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of soaked and ground maize and serves as a base material for various cooked foods such as flatbreads, dumplings, and porridges.

## Raw Materials
- Maize kernels (*Zea mays*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Maize kernels are soaked in water for one to several days, after which they are wet-milled into a dough. The dough is allowed to ferment naturally at ambient temperature for 1–3 days. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria acidify the dough, which is then used directly in cooking or lightly dried for later use.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These microorganisms produce organic acids that lower pH, enhance flavour, and contribute to microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Acidification improves shelf-life of maize dough  
- Enhanced flavour development compared to unfermented maize  
- Provides a versatile intermediate product for multiple foods  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented maize doughs such as masa are integral to traditional Andean food systems and reflect Indigenous knowledge of cereal processing and preservation prior to cooking.

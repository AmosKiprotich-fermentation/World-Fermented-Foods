## Overview
Hardaliye is a traditional non-alcoholic fermented beverage produced in the Thrace region of Turkey from grape juice. It is characterised by a mildly sour taste and is produced through lactic acid fermentation.

## Raw Materials
- Grapes (*Vitis vinifera*)
- Mustard seeds
- Cherry leaves
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Crushed grapes are placed in containers along with mustard seeds and cherry leaves. The mixture is allowed to ferment naturally for 5–10 days at ambient temperature. Lactic acid fermentation occurs without significant alcohol production due to antimicrobial compounds present in mustard seeds.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria convert grape sugars into organic acids, contributing to flavour and microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Production of organic acids without alcohol formation  
- Retention of grape-derived phenolic compounds  
- Mild preservation through acidification  

## Cultural Significance
Hardaliye is traditionally consumed as a refreshing beverage in northwestern Turkey and represents a unique fruit-based lactic fermentation adapted for non-alcoholic consumption.

## Overview
**Curtido** is a traditional fermented cabbage slaw widely consumed in El Salvador and neighbouring regions of Central America. It is typically served as an accompaniment to *pupusas* and represents a short-term lactic acid vegetable fermentation.

## Raw Materials
- Cabbage
- Carrots
- Onions
- Salt
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Vegetables are finely sliced, salted, and lightly pressed to release juice. The mixture is allowed to ferment spontaneously for **several hours to a few days**, depending on desired acidity, often at ambient temperature.

## Microbial Ecology
Curtido fermentation is driven primarily by lactic acid bacteria, including:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

Rapid acidification limits spoilage and pathogen growth.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Short fermentation preserves vegetable crunch  
- Organic acids enhance flavour and shelf-life  
- Provides live lactic acid bacteria when consumed fresh  

## Cultural Significance
Curtido is an essential component of Salvadoran cuisine and reflects Indigenous and Spanish influences on Central American fermented vegetable traditions.

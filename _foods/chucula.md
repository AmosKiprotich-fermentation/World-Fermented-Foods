## Overview
Chucula is a traditional fermented beverage from the Andean region of Colombia, made from cacao, cereals, and spices. It undergoes spontaneous fermentation and is consumed as a thick, nourishing drink.

## Raw Materials
- Cacao beans (*Theobroma cacao*)
- Maize or wheat
- Water
- Spices (regionally variable)

## Fermentation Process
Cacao beans and cereals are cooked and ground into a paste, which is mixed with water and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–2 days. The fermented mixture is later diluted and heated prior to consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- Lactic acid bacteria
- Yeasts

These microorganisms contribute to acidification, flavour complexity, and mild preservation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Provides carbohydrates and cacao-derived bioactive compounds  
- Acidification enhances flavour and stability  
- Traditionally regarded as a strengthening food  

## Cultural Significance
Chucula is associated with rural Andean food traditions and reflects the integration of cacao into Indigenous fermentation practices.

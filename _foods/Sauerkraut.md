## Description
Sauerkraut is fermented shredded cabbage preserved through salt-driven lactic acid fermentation.

## Fermentation process
- Cabbage shredded and mixed with salt
- Packed to exclude oxygen; brine forms naturally
- Fermented for days to weeks depending on temperature and preference

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Early: *Leuconostoc mesenteroides*
- Later: *Lactobacillus plantarum*, *Lactobacillus brevis* (often reported)

## Functional relevance
- Acidification improves shelf-life and safety
- Provides organic acids and potential probiotic-associated LAB (strain-dependent)

## Overview
**Coyol wine** is a traditional fermented beverage produced from the sap of the coyol palm (*Acrocomia aculeata*) in Central America. The sap ferments rapidly after collection, yielding a mildly to moderately alcoholic drink consumed fresh.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh palm sap (coyol palm)
- Environmental microorganisms (no starter culture)

## Fermentation Process
Palm sap is collected by tapping the inflorescence or trunk and is consumed or fermented immediately. Spontaneous fermentation begins within hours due to native yeasts and bacteria. Typical fermentation lasts **12–48 hours**, producing ethanol, organic acids, and aromatic compounds.

## Microbial Ecology
The fermentation involves a mixed microbial consortium, including:
- Yeasts (*Saccharomyces* spp. and related genera) responsible for ethanol production
- Lactic acid bacteria contributing to acidification and flavour balance

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Rapid conversion of sugars into ethanol  
- Contains organic acids that limit spoilage during short storage  
- Provides calories and micronutrients derived from palm sap  

## Cultural Significance
Coyol wine has long been consumed in rural Central America and is associated with seasonal palm tapping practices. It represents traditional knowledge of sap fermentation in tropical environments.

## Overview
**Chicha morada** is a traditional Peruvian beverage made from purple maize (*Zea mays* L.). Unlike alcoholic chicha varieties, chicha morada undergoes minimal fermentation and is typically non-alcoholic, valued for its colour, flavour, and phytochemical content.

## Raw Materials
- Purple maize (*Zea mays* L.)
- Water
- Fruits and spices (pineapple peel, cinnamon, clove; optional)
- Sugar (added after fermentation)

## Fermentation Process
Purple maize is boiled in water to extract pigments and soluble compounds. After cooling, the liquid may undergo **brief spontaneous fermentation (12–48 hours)** driven by lactic acid bacteria. The beverage is then strained, sweetened, and consumed fresh.

## Microbial Ecology
Short fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

These bacteria contribute mild acidification without significant ethanol production.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant activity  
- Mild organic acid content improves flavour stability  
- Traditionally consumed as a refreshing and functional beverage  

## Cultural Significance
Chicha morada has deep cultural roots in Andean civilisation and remains widely consumed in Peru as a non-alcoholic alternative to fermented maize beers, especially in urban and household settings.

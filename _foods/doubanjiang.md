## Description
Doubanjiang is a traditional Chinese fermented broad bean and chili paste, central to Sichuan cuisine and known for salty, spicy, umami-rich flavor.

## Fermentation process
- Broad beans cooked and inoculated with starter molds (region-dependent)
- Mixed with chili and salt
- Fermented for months to years, often with sun exposure and periodic mixing

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- Molds: *Aspergillus* spp. (starter-dependent)
- LAB and yeasts contribute during brine fermentation

## Functional relevance
- Extensive protein hydrolysis and flavor generation
- Shelf-stable condiment via salt and fermentation acids

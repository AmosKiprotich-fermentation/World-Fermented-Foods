## Overview
**Agbelima** is a traditional fermented cassava dough widely consumed in southern Ghana. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of grated cassava roots and serves as a staple intermediate product for foods such as *Banku* and *Akple*.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Cassava roots are peeled, washed, grated, and mixed with water. The mash is packed and allowed to ferment naturally for **2–4 days**, during which endogenous and environmental microorganisms drive lactic acid fermentation. The fermented mass is then pressed to remove excess liquid, yielding agbelima dough.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by **lactic acid bacteria**, particularly:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These organisms lower the pH, inhibit spoilage microbes, and contribute to flavor and safety.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Reduction of cyanogenic glycosides naturally present in cassava  
- Improved shelf-life compared to raw cassava mash  
- Mild sour flavor and elastic dough texture  

## Cultural Significance
Agbelima is central to the preparation of **Banku**, a widely consumed Ghanaian fermented staple, and plays an important role in household-level food processing and food security.

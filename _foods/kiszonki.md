## Overview
**Kiszonki** is a collective term for traditional Polish fermented vegetables, including cabbage, cucumbers, and beetroot, preserved through spontaneous lactic acid fermentation.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh vegetables (e.g. cabbage, cucumbers, beetroot)
- Salt
- Water (for brine)

## Fermentation Process
Vegetables are submerged in salted brine and fermented at cool ambient temperatures for **days to weeks**. Lactic acid bacteria sequentially dominate the fermentation, leading to acidification and preservation.

## Microbial Ecology
Key microorganisms include:
- *Leuconostoc mesenteroides* (early fermentation)
- *Lactobacillus plantarum* (late fermentation)

These species drive acidification and flavour development.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- High organic acid content improves shelf-life  
- Retention of vitamins and minerals  
- Source of live lactic acid bacteria  

## Cultural Significance
Kiszonki are deeply embedded in Polish culinary traditions and are consumed year-round, particularly during winter months when fresh vegetables are scarce.

## Overview
Lafun is a traditional fermented cassava flour widely consumed in southwestern Nigeria. It is produced through spontaneous fermentation of cassava roots followed by drying and milling.

## Raw Materials
- Cassava roots (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Cassava roots are peeled, washed, and soaked in water for 2–5 days to undergo natural fermentation. During this period, endogenous microorganisms initiate lactic acid fermentation. The fermented roots are then dried and milled into flour, which can be reconstituted and cooked prior to consumption.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria contribute to acidification and detoxification of cassava.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Reduction of cyanogenic compounds  
- Improved shelf-life through drying  
- Development of sour flavour  

## Cultural Significance
Lafun is a staple food in many communities in southwestern Nigeria and serves as a preserved form of cassava that can be stored for extended periods and prepared as needed.

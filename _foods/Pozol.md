## Overview
**Pozol** is a traditional fermented maize dough and beverage consumed in southern Mexico and parts of Central America. It is prepared from nixtamalized maize and represents an important non-alcoholic cereal fermentation in the Americas.

## Raw Materials
- Maize kernels (*Zea mays*)
- Lime (calcium hydroxide) for nixtamalization
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Maize kernels are cooked with lime, washed, and ground into dough. The dough is shaped into balls and allowed to ferment spontaneously for **1–3 days**. Fermented dough can be diluted with water and consumed as a beverage or eaten as a food.

## Microbial Ecology
Pozol fermentation involves a mixed microbial community, primarily:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Streptococcus* spp.
- Various yeasts

These microorganisms contribute to acidification, flavour development, and microbial stability.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved protein and starch digestibility  
- Reduced microbial spoilage during storage  
- Provides energy and hydration in tropical environments  

## Cultural Significance
Pozol has long been consumed by Indigenous Maya communities and is closely associated with agricultural labour and daily sustenance in hot climates.

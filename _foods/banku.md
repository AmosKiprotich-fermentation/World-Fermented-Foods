## Overview
Banku is a traditional fermented staple food widely consumed in southern Ghana. It is prepared from a mixture of fermented maize dough and fermented cassava dough (agbelima), which are cooked together to form a smooth, elastic paste.

## Raw Materials
- Fermented maize dough (*Zea mays*)
- Fermented cassava dough (*Manihot esculenta*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Maize grains are soaked, wet-milled, and allowed to ferment naturally for 1–3 days. Cassava is separately grated and fermented to produce agbelima. The fermented maize and cassava doughs are then mixed with water and cooked while stirring continuously until a cohesive, elastic texture is achieved.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation of the maize and cassava components is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.

These lactic acid bacteria drive acidification, enhance flavour, and contribute to microbial safety prior to cooking.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Reduction of cyanogenic compounds in cassava  
- Improved digestibility through fermentation  
- Development of mild sour flavour and elastic texture  

## Cultural Significance
Banku is a major staple food in Ghana and is commonly consumed with soups, stews, and grilled fish. It represents a key example of combined cereal and root fermentation in West African food systems.

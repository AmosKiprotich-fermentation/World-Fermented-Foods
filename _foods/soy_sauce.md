## Overview
Soy sauce is a traditional fermented seasoning widely used across East Asia. It is produced through a complex, multi-stage fermentation of soybeans and wheat, resulting in a salty liquid rich in amino acids and flavour compounds.

## Raw Materials
- Soybeans (*Glycine max*)
- Wheat
- Salt
- Water
- Starter culture (koji molds)

## Fermentation Process
Cooked soybeans and roasted wheat are inoculated with koji molds to produce a solid starter known as koji. The koji is mixed with salt brine to form a mash (moromi), which undergoes extended fermentation lasting several months to years. During this period, enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial metabolism generate amino acids, sugars, organic acids, and aroma compounds. The fermented mash is then pressed, pasteurised, and bottled.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Aspergillus oryzae* and *Aspergillus sojae*
- *Zygosaccharomyces* spp.
- *Lactobacillus* spp.

Koji molds produce proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes, while yeasts and lactic acid bacteria contribute to flavour development, ethanol production, and acidification.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Extensive protein hydrolysis yields free amino acids  
- Development of umami flavour compounds  
- High salt content contributes to preservation  

## Cultural Significance
Soy sauce is a foundational component of East Asian cuisines and reflects a highly developed fermentation technology refined over centuries. It plays a central role in household cooking, regional food identities, and traditional fermentation industries.

## Overview
San Francisco–style sourdough is a naturally leavened bread characterised by pronounced acidity and distinctive flavour. It is produced using a stable microbial starter culture maintained through backslopping.

## Raw Materials
- Wheat flour
- Water
- Sourdough starter culture

## Fermentation Process
Flour and water are mixed with a starter culture and allowed to ferment over several hours to days. The dough undergoes repeated refreshment cycles, followed by baking to produce leavened bread.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis*
- *Saccharomyces* spp.

These microorganisms coexist symbiotically, producing organic acids and carbon dioxide.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Improved mineral bioavailability  
- Organic acid production contributes to flavour  
- Extended shelf-life compared to yeast-only bread  

## Cultural Significance
San Francisco sourdough is a regional food identity and a well-studied model system in cereal fermentation microbiology.

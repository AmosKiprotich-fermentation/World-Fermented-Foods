## Overview
**Pulque** is a traditional fermented beverage produced from the sap of agave plants (*Agave* spp.) and has been consumed in central Mexico for over 2,000 years. It represents one of the oldest documented alcoholic fermentations in the Americas.

## Raw Materials
- Fresh agave sap (*aguamiel*)
- Environmental microorganisms (no starter culture)

## Fermentation Process
Freshly collected agave sap is transferred to fermentation vessels and allowed to ferment spontaneously for **24–72 hours**. Fermentation involves a complex consortium of bacteria and yeasts that convert sugars into ethanol, organic acids, and polysaccharides.

## Microbial Ecology
Pulque fermentation is characterised by a diverse microbial community including:
- *Zymomonas mobilis* (ethanol production)
- *Lactobacillus* spp. and *Leuconostoc* spp. (acidification)
- *Saccharomyces* spp. and other yeasts

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Moderate alcohol content (2–6%)  
- Contains microbial polysaccharides contributing to viscosity  
- Traditionally considered nutritive due to B vitamins and microbial biomass  

## Cultural Significance
Pulque holds deep cultural and ritual importance in Mexican history, particularly among pre-Hispanic civilizations, and remains a symbol of indigenous fermentation knowledge.

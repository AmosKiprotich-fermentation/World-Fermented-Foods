## Description
Pulque is a traditional Mexican fermented beverage produced from the sap of agave plants, historically consumed in central Mexico.

## Fermentation process
- Sap (aguamiel) collected from mature agave plants
- Sap allowed to ferment spontaneously
- Fermentation proceeds for hours to days, depending on desired acidity and alcohol content

## Reported microbiology (examples)
- LAB: *Lactobacillus* spp., *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts: *Saccharomyces* spp., *Candida* spp.
- Microbial composition varies with region and handling practices

## Functional relevance
- Production of organic acids and ethanol
- Source of fermentative metabolites and nutrients
- Cultural and historical significance in Mesoamerican societies

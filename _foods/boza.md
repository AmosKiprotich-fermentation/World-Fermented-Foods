## Overview
Boza is a traditional fermented cereal beverage widely consumed in parts of Southeast Europe and Turkey. It is produced through fermentation of cooked cereal slurry and is characterised by a thick consistency, mild acidity, and low alcohol content.

## Raw Materials
- Cereal grains (commonly millet; also wheat or maize)
- Water
- Sugar (often added after fermentation)

## Fermentation Process
Cereal grains are cooked in water until soft and then milled or mashed into a slurry. After cooling, the mixture is allowed to ferment naturally or by backslopping with a previous batch for 1–2 days at ambient temperature. Sugar is frequently added after fermentation, and the beverage is consumed fresh under refrigeration.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Lactobacillus* spp.
- *Leuconostoc* spp.
- Yeasts

Lactic acid bacteria are responsible for acidification, while yeasts contribute to flavour development and limited ethanol production.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Mild acidification enhances flavour and short-term stability  
- Provides carbohydrates and energy  
- Contains live microorganisms when consumed fresh  

## Cultural Significance
Boza has a long history in the Balkans and Anatolia and is traditionally consumed during colder seasons. It is commonly sold by street vendors and represents a culturally important fermented beverage in the region.

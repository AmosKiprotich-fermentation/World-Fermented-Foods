## Overview
Fermented pandanus paste, locally known as *te tuae* in Kiribati, is a traditional preserved food produced from the fruit of pandanus trees. It is prepared through spontaneous fermentation and drying and serves as a long-term carbohydrate reserve in atoll environments.

## Raw Materials
- Ripe pandanus fruit (*Pandanus tectorius*)
- Water (as needed during processing)

## Fermentation Process
Ripe pandanus fruits are cooked to soften the pulp, which is then mashed and allowed to ferment naturally. Fermentation may proceed for several days before the paste is dried or further processed into cakes or rolls for long-term storage. The combined fermentation and drying stabilise the product for extended periods.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:

- Lactic acid bacteria

These microorganisms contribute to acidification, flavour development, and suppression of spoilage organisms during early fermentation.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Long-term preservation of a seasonal fruit crop  
- Provides carbohydrates and provitamin A carotenoids  
- Acidification contributes to microbial stability  

## Cultural Significance
Fermented pandanus paste is culturally important in Micronesian societies, particularly in low-lying atoll environments where food preservation is critical. It represents Indigenous adaptation to limited agricultural resources and seasonal food availability.

## Overview
Cider is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage produced from apple juice and widely consumed across Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. It is obtained through yeast-driven fermentation of apple sugars and varies in acidity, alcohol content, and sweetness depending on regional practices.

## Raw Materials
- Apples (*Malus domestica*)
- Water (minimal, if any)
- Indigenous or selected yeast cultures

## Fermentation Process
Apples are crushed and pressed to extract juice, which is then allowed to ferment in vats or barrels. Fermentation proceeds spontaneously or with inoculation and typically lasts several weeks, during which sugars are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. After fermentation, cider may be clarified, aged, or bottled.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Saccharomyces* spp.
- Non-*Saccharomyces* yeasts

Yeasts are primarily responsible for alcoholic fermentation, while secondary microbial activity can influence flavour complexity and acidity.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Conversion of fruit sugars into ethanol  
- Retention of apple-derived organic acids and polyphenols  
- Fermentation enhances flavour complexity  

## Cultural Significance
Cider holds strong cultural significance in many European regions and is associated with traditional orchards, seasonal harvests, and rural food economies. It represents one of the oldest fruit-based fermentation traditions in Europe.

## Overview
Ogiri is a traditional fermented condiment produced from oilseeds and widely consumed in southeastern Nigeria. It is obtained through spontaneous alkaline fermentation and is commonly used to enhance the flavour of soups and stews.

## Raw Materials
- Melon seeds (*Citrullus lanatus*) or castor oil seeds (*Ricinus communis*)
- Water

## Fermentation Process
Oilseeds are boiled to soften the cotyledons and then wrapped in leaves to ferment naturally for 2–4 days at ambient temperature. During fermentation, microbial activity leads to extensive protein breakdown and development of a characteristic aroma.

## Microbial Ecology
Fermentation is dominated by:
- *Bacillus* spp.

These microorganisms produce proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyse seed proteins and contribute to the alkaline nature of the product.

## Functional and Nutritional Aspects
- Enhanced protein digestibility  
- Development of strong characteristic flavour  
- Used in small quantities as seasoning  

## Cultural Significance
Ogiri is an essential condiment in traditional Igbo cuisine and plays an important role in enhancing the flavour of vegetable and soup-based dishes.
